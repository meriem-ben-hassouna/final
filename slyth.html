        <h2 class="c-">congratulations!
            <br>you're a Slytherin
            <br>Salazar valued cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition. <br>
              Many Slytherin students tend to clique together, often acquiring leaders, which further exemplifies Slytherin's ambitious qualities. <br>
              The emblematic animal of the house is a snake and the house's colours are green and silver. <br>
              Slytherin corresponds roughly with the element of water due to serpents being commonly associated with the sea and lochs , as well as serpents being physically fluid and flexible animals. <br>
               Similarly, water is seen as a portal to another world, leading some to speculate that the element was chosen to symbolise many Slytherins' hope for a pure-blood only community. <br>
                The colours also correspond with waters around lakes and lochs often being green, and silver being often associated with grey rainwater.
