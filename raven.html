            <br>you're a Ravenclaw
            <br>Members of this house are characterised by their wit, learning, and wisdom. <br>
             The emblematic animal symbol is an eagle, and blue and bronze are its colours. <br>
             

            Ravenclaw corresponds roughly to the element of air, and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen; blue and bronze represent the sky and eagle feathers respectively, both having much to do with air.
