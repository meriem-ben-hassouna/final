            <br>you're a Gryffindor
            <br> Gryffindor instructed the Sorting Hat to choose students possessing characteristics he most valued, such as courage, chivalry, and determination, to be sorted into his house. <br> The emblematic animal is a lion, and its colours are scarlet and gold. <br>

            Gryffindor corresponds roughly to the element of fire, and it is for this reason that the colours scarlet and gold were chosen to represent the house. <br> The colour of fire corresponds to that of a lion as well, with scarlet representing the mane and tail and gold representing the coat.
