            <br>you're a Hufflepuff
            <br> Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses; valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its members. <br>
             The emblematic animal was a badger, yellow and black were its house colours. <br>
              

            Hufflepuff corresponded roughly to the element of earth, and it is for that reason that the House colours were chosen: yellow represented wheat, while black was emblematic of soil. <br>
              Students sorted into Hufflepuff often demonstrate exceptional abilities in Herbology, owing to their correspondence to earth.
